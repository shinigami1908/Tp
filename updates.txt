# AI-Assisted Performance Review & Bias Analytics Platform

## 🚀 Overview
Performance reviews often feel subjective and inconsistent.  
Managers spend significant time navigating multiple systems and still struggle to:

- Understand true performance impact
- Detect early warning signals
- Provide constructive and unbiased feedback

This solution transforms employee evaluation into **data-driven decision making** by combining:
✔ Engineering productivity metrics  
✔ Learning & presence indicators  
✔ Manager & peer feedback  
✔ GPT-powered bias review & narrative insights

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Unified Performance ETL | Extracts from Jira / GitHub / LMS / RTO / Manager Inputs |
| KPI Engine | Normalizes all metrics into objective performance signals |
| Bias Detection | Flags when manager rating is too high/low vs data |
| Behavioral Insights | Identifies risk signals + improvement opportunities |
| H1 vs H2 Trend Insights | Tracks improvement or decline in performance |
| Automated Narrative | Rewrites manager comments to align with objective data |
| Future Performance Signals | Predictive insight based on current trajectory |
| Seamless Manager Dashboard | JSON response ready for UI consumption |

## 🔍 How It Works (Narrative Flow)

1️⃣ **Backend loads performance signals**  
(Version-controlled mockdata used in hackathon)

2️⃣ **KPIs computed per employee + per period**  
Feature engineering normalizes:

- Delivery → story completion ratio
- Quality → defect escape rate
- Collaboration → PRs, reviews, sentiments
- Growth → LMS + IDP progress
- Presence → RTO compliance

3️⃣ **Expected rating score computed**  
Transparent rules + red-flag dictionary

4️⃣ **Bias comparison**
> "Manager very high / slightly high / aligned / slightly low / very low"

5️⃣ **Report cards bundled & stored in Tachyon**  
One file per run — manager queries always fetch fresh insights

6️⃣ **GPT transforms analytics to human-friendly insights**  
- Strengths
- Risks
- Trends across H1/H2
- *Rewrites manager comments* where necessary
- *Predicts likely future performance trajectory*

7️⃣ **Final UI-ready JSON returned**
